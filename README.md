## Boards


### Background and Overview
`Boards` is a data visualization application for NBA statisticss. These stats can often be difficult to parse, but boards is an elegant display of your favorite teams and players' stats. 

Reading numbers off of a screen hardly shows the differentiation between one player to the next. Data visualization can create a more simple, yet just as robust way of analyzing NBA statistics.  


### Functionality & MVP

In Boards, users will be able to:
- [x] Select various player statistics to display
- [x] Filter data to certain players based upon input given
- [x] See live stats of the visualization
- [x] Start, pause, and restart the visualization

### Wireframes
The app will map out various statistical values for respective players, teams, and combinations of the two.

The app will consist of a single screen with the visualizations, and filters. The upper right will have icons linking to my GitHub and LinkedIn profile.

### Data and API

The app will consist of a single screen with the settings, filter controls, and stats on top. The upper right will have icons linking to my GitHub and LinkedIn profile. 

The API the app will be utilizing comes from NBA.com, the official NBA website, and their stats API through a library. The library is necessary for live statistical updates.


### Architectures and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- Vanilla JavaScript for overall structure and logic,
- `D3.js` for data visualization


### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**
- [ ] Read up and get inspired by the D3 Gallery
- [ ] Test endpoints in Postman with the approporiate headers
- [ ] Determine if data will be stored locally or not

**Day 2:** 
- [ ] Pick and Choose tutorial repositories based on my prospective visualizations' needs

- [ ] If storing data locally, format in JSON 

- [ ] If using data from an API, create and setup Node backend, and test for responses

**Day 3:** 
- [ ] Familarize with D3 documentation, and learn how to read data in D3
- [ ] Begin to manipulate actual data and create graphs, plots, and charts

**Day 4:** Settings and stats.
Goals for the day:
- [ ] Determine which NBA data is useful
- [ ] Begin rendering Data 

**Day 5:** 
- [ ] Style data, creating responsize, clean visualizations

**Day 6:** 
- [ ] Continue Styling
- [ ] Touching up. Adding GitHub and LinkedIn icons. Styling. Any user experience enhancements

**Day 7:** 
- [ ] Site deployment to sameehkhan.com
