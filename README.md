## Boards


### Background and Overview
`Boards` is a data visualization application for NBA stats. These stats can often be difficult to parse, but boards is an elegant display of your favorite teams and players' stats.


### Functionality & MVP

In Boards, users will be able to:
- [x] Select various player statistics to display
- [x] Filter data to certain players based upon input given
- [x] See live stats of the visualization
- [x] Start, pause, and restart the visualization

### Wireframes

The app will consist of a single screen with the visualizations, and filters. The upper right will have icons linking to my GitHub and LinkedIn profile.

### Data and API


The app will consist of a single screen with the settings, playback controls, and stats on top. The upper right will have icons linking to my GitHub and LinkedIn profile.


### Architectures and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- Vanilla JavaScript for overall structure and logic,
- `HTML5 Canvas` for DOM manipulation and rendering,
- `D3` for data visualization


### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**
- [ ] Read up and get inspired by the D3 Gallery
- [ ] Test endpoints in Postman with the approporiate headers
- [ ] Determine if data will be stored locally or not

**Day 2:** 
- [ ] Pick and Choose tutorial repositories based on my prospective visualizations' needs

- [ ] If storing data locally, format in JSON 

- [ ] If using data from an API, create and setup Node backend, and test for responses

**Day 3:** 
- [ ] Familarize with D3 documentation, and learn how to read data in D3
- [ ] Begin to manipulate actual data and create graphs, plots, and charts

**Day 4:** Settings and stats.
Goals for the day:
- [ ] Determine which NBA data is useful
- [ ] Begin rendering Data 

**Day 5:** 
- [ ] Style data, creating responsize, clean visualizations

**Day 6:** 
- [ ] Continue Styling
- [ ] Touching up. Adding GitHub and LinkedIn icons. Styling. Any user experience enhancements

**Day 7:** 
- [ ] Site deployment to sameehkhan.com
